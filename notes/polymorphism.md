### note on polymorphisms on C++

First we should define what polymorphism means. According to wikipedia, **polymorphism** is "the provision of a single interface to entities of different types." As a mathematician, to me, polymorphism is just a fancy word for "functoriality". By restricting which categories these functors act on and the natural transformations between them, we could get various forms of polymorphism in the computer science context.

Accordingly, there are 4 principal types of polymorphism in C++.
